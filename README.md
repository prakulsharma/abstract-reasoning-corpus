# Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus

## Overview

In his paper "On the Measure of Intelligence," François Chollet critiques the prevailing task-specific methods used to assess AI intelligence as insufficient. He argues that true intelligence involves the ability to efficiently acquire skills across various domains, which these methods fail to measure. To address this, Chollet introduced the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), designed to test AI on tasks requiring broad, human-like intelligence. These tasks highlight the significance of inherent understanding and minimal data generalization.

Building on Chollet’s work, my project aims to tackle the ARC challenge through a unique method that integrates human insights with the capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The primary objective is to develop a collection of human-annotated explanations detailing the reasoning behind solving ARC problems. This collection will help fine-tune an open-source LLM, enhancing its problem-solving strategies to more closely resemble human thought processes.

## Project Steps

1. **Annotation Creation**: The project begins by crafting detailed, step-by-step explanations for both the training and evaluation sets of the ARC challenge. These annotations will elucidate the logical and abstract reasoning required to navigate ARC’s complex problem space.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning**: Utilizing the annotations, I will employ a two-stage fine-tuning process for the LLM:

    - Generate detailed guides on solving ARC tasks based on the annotations.
    - Use these guides to predict the outcomes of ARC tasks, employing a chain-of-thought approach.

3. **(Optional) Multimodal LLM Fine-Tuning**: Considering the integration of visual data in human problem-solving, I am contemplating fine-tuning a multimodal LLM, though recent studies suggest these may perform less effectively in reasoning tasks compared to standard LLMs.

4. **Dashboard and Live Demo**: The project will culminate in the creation of a dashboard and a live demonstration where I will compare the human-generated annotations against those produced by the fine-tuned LLM.

## Expected Outcomes and Impact

This project explores the potential to enhance LLMs' problem-solving capabilities by guiding them with human-annotated explanations. The goal is to determine if an LLM can be trained to understand and emulate human-like reasoning paths for complex problem solving and to accurately apply these methods to achieve correct solutions. This serves as a preliminary step towards more sophisticated systems capable of human-like reasoning and problem-solving, setting the stage for further research into overcoming the limitations and challenges faced by current AI models.
