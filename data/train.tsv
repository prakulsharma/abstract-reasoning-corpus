The main object are the L-shaped light blue objects. Once we have their position, we find the location of the missing corner of the square that each L-shape would create. Then we fill the missing corner with a dark blue pixel to complete the square.	get_objects(grid, by_color=False) - to identify objects based on color, particularly the light blue L-shapes. fill_value(grid, pos, value) - to fill in the missing corner with a dark blue pixel.	1. Use get_objects(grid, by_color=False) to detect and list all the L-shaped objects in light blue. 2. For each L-shaped object:          1. Determine the coordinates of the missing corner that would complete the square. This can be deduced from the positions of the L-shape pixels.         2. Use fill_value(grid, pos, value) to place a dark blue pixel in the missing corner position, where pos are the missing corner's coordinates and value is the colour dark blue.
08ed6ac7.png	The task involves identifying four grey bars of varying lengths in the input and assigning colours to them based on their relative lengths: the shortest bar becomes yellow, the second shortest green, the next one red, and the longest one blue.	Each grey bar is an important object. Changes to these objects are as follows: Color change based on the length of the bar, from grey to yellow, green, red, or blue.	get_objects(grid, by_col=True) to identify the bars which are columns of grey pixels. sort (a standard Python function, not listed but implied) to sort the bars by their lengths. change_object_color(obj, value) to change the color of the bars.	1. Use get_objects(grid, by_col=True) to identify columns of grey pixels, treating each as an object. 2. Sort the objects by their cell_count (number of grey pixels) in ascending order. 3. Change the color of the objects based on their sorted order:  1. Shortest bar to yellow using change_object_color(obj, value).  2. Second shortest bar to green.  3. Third bar to red.  4. Longest bar to blue.
29c11459.png	The task involves identifying pairs of colored pixels on the far left and far right columns of a grid. A line is then drawn to connect each pair, with the line being split into two colors: half in the color of the left pixel and the other half in the color of the right pixel. The center pixel of the line is colored grey.	Pairs of edge pixels are connected with a two-toned horizontal line, where the midpoint is grey.	get_pixel_coords(grid) to identify the positions of colored pixels. fill_between_coords(grid, coord_1, coord_2, value) to draw the connecting lines with the correct color on each half. fill_value(grid, pos, value) to color the center pixel grey.	1. Use get_pixel_coords(grid) to find the coordinates of colored pixels on the leftmost and rightmost columns. 2. Match the pixels on the opposite edges that have the same y-coordinate. 3. For each matched pair, draw a horizontal line across the grid that is split into two colors:  1. The left half of the line matches the color of the left pixel.  2. The right half of the line matches the color of the right pixel. 4. Use fill_between_coords(grid, coord_1, coord_2, value) to color each half of the line, stopping one pixel short at the center. 5. Use fill_value(grid, pos, value) where pos is the center of the line, and value is grey. 6. Repeat this process for each pair of matched pixels.
952a094c.png	The task involves translating the colored pixels inside the colored square to the outside and diagonally opposite ends of the square.	The pixels are in the interior corners of the colored square. They are moved to the diagonally opposite and outer ends of the square.	get_pixel_coords can be used to get the pixel values and coordinates. 	1. obtain the pixels in the interior corners of the square 2. move them to their diagonally opposite ends in the outer region of the square.
484b58aa.png	This task is a denoising task. The input grid features a underlying repeating lattice pattern with some part of the grid removed. The goal is to recover the missing pixels and obtain a perfect lattice.	Most of the pixels remain the same. The empty pixels are filled with the appropriate values such that the image becomes a repeating lattice pattern. There are no empty pixels left.	crop_grid can be used to extract the repeating grid patttern.	1. Loop through all possible rectangular subgrids until a repeating pattern is found. 2. Extract that pattern using crop_grid. 3. Fill the missing pixels using the extracted pattern
